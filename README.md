Reddit uses KARMA to give scores to the users based on the Upvotes obtained on posts and comments. But the score tells you about the overall performance of the user in the reddit and not in your interested subreddit.

## Problem
Suppose you are intersted in r/startups subreddit and you need to know the user who is extremely active on that subreddit and is getting lots of Upvotes. KARMA cannot help you because it cannot say if a user got his majority of scores from your desired subreddit. 

## Solution
To help you with this scenario, the application provides you with top 25 redditors in your desired subreddit ranked by average upvotes on his comments. The ranking is based on the users performance over the past months on their top 25 performing comments. The number of comments is restricted as it is sufficient to get the top performers based on their top 25 best comments.
